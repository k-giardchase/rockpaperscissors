Rock Paper Scissors

OVERVIEW

Get the two separate inputs from two players, compare them using the RPS rules, and then display appropriate result:

R versus S => R wins
R versus P => P wins
P versus S => S wins
draw if both players choose the same

========================
Spec What

1. First player inputs 'Rock' and second player inputs 'scissors' and the output is 'player 1'
input: input1: 'rock',
       input2: 'scissors'
output: 'player1'

2. First player inputs 'Rock' and second player inputs 'paper' and the output is 'player 2'
input: input1: 'rock',
       input2: 'paper'
output: 'player2'

3. First player inputs 'Rock' and second player inputs 'Rock' and the output is 'player 2'
input: input1: 'rock',
       input2: 'rock'
output: 'draw'

4. First player inputs 'Scissors' and second player inputs 'rock' and the output is 'player 1'
input: input1: 'scissors',
       input2: 'rock'
output: 'player2'

5. First player inputs 'Scissors' and second player inputs 'paper' and the output is 'player 2'
input: input1: 'scissors',
       input2: 'paper'
output: 'player1'

6. First player inputs 'Scissors' and second player inputs 'Scissors' and the output is 'player 2'
input: input1: 'scissors',
       input2: 'scissors'
output: 'draw'

7. First player inputs 'Paper' and second player inputs 'rock' and the output is 'player 1'
input: input1: 'paper',
       input2: 'rock'
output: 'player1'

8. First player inputs 'Paper' and second player inputs 'scissors' and the output is 'player 2'
input: input1: 'paper',
       input2: 'scissors'
output: 'player2'

9. First player inputs 'Paper' and second player inputs 'Paper' and the output is 'draw'
input: input1: 'paper',
       input2: 'paper'
output: 'draw'

10. First player inputs capitalized input and second player also inputs capitalized input and the inputs will still be compared as above.
input: input1: 'CAPS',
       input2: 'CAPS'
output: 'normal'




========================
Spec How

1.  convert inputs to lowercase. two variables player1 and player2. Nested if statements.
    For example, if player1 chooses rock then have possibilites for player2 choices.
    if (player1 == 'rock') {
        if (player2 == 'x'){
            {

            }
        } elseif (player2 == 'y')
    }
